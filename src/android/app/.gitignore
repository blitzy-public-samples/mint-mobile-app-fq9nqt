# Human Tasks:
# 1. Ensure Android Studio is configured to respect .gitignore patterns
# 2. Run 'git rm --cached' on any previously tracked files that should now be ignored
# 3. Verify that sensitive files like local.properties are not already tracked
# 4. Configure ProGuard rules appropriately for release builds

# Requirements addressed:
# - Native Android Application (Technical Specification/1.1 System Overview)
#   Excludes build outputs and IDE files specific to Android development
# - Security Architecture (Technical Specification/5.4 Security Architecture)
#   Prevents sensitive configuration files and credentials from being committed
# - Development Environment (Technical Specification/7.1 Programming Languages)
#   Maintains clean version control for Android/Kotlin development environment
