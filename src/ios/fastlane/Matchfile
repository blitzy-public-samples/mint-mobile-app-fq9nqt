# Version: fastlane-match 2.210.0

# Human Tasks:
# 1. Set up AWS S3 bucket with server-side encryption for certificate storage
# 2. Configure AWS IAM role with appropriate S3 bucket permissions
# 3. Set up the following environment variables in CI system:
#    - MATCH_GIT_URL: Git repository URL for certificate storage
#    - MATCH_S3_BUCKET: AWS S3 bucket name for certificate storage
#    - APPLE_ID: Apple Developer account email
#    - MATCH_PASSWORD: Password for certificate encryption
# 4. Ensure Apple Developer Program membership is active
# 5. Verify proper code signing certificates are generated in Apple Developer Portal
