## Best Practices

1. Write isolated, deterministic tests
2. Follow AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern
3. Use meaningful test descriptions
4. Maintain test data fixtures
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Implement proper cleanup
7. Version control test assets
8. Document test requirements
9. Regular test maintenance
10. Monitor test execution times

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Test timeouts: Adjust timeouts in jest.config.js
- Database connection: Verify test database credentials
- Mobile device detection: Check USB debugging/trust settings
- Performance test failures: Verify system resources
- Security test false positives: Review security rules

## Contributing

1. Follow test naming conventions
2. Maintain test documentation
3. Update test data as needed
4. Review test coverage reports
5. Validate security implications
6. Consider accessibility impact
7. Optimize test performance
8. Update CI/CD configurations
